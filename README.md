This program serves as a proof of concept for remote process injection using a binary resource file as the payload. By default it injects in to explorer.exe, but first does a domin and user check of current process, starts the process snapshot iteration to find the next explorer.exe, does a check on that process's domain and user, does a validation that they match, and then allows payload to inject. If it does not match, keeps iterating until process name matches with current domain and user.
